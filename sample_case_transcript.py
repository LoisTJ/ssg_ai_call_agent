Agent (Mr. Tan):
Good morning, you’ve reached the SkillsFuture Singapore Call Centre. My name is Mr. Tan. How may I assist you today?

Customer (Ms. Lim):
Hi, Mr. Tan. This is Ms. Lim from LearnPro Training Centre. I’m calling about an issue we’re facing with learner e-attendance registration using the Singpass app.

Agent (Mr. Tan):
Thank you for reaching out, Ms. Lim. Could you share more details about the issue?

Customer (Ms. Lim):
Sure. Some of our learners are unable to log their attendance through Singpass during our recent course sessions. When they scan the QR code, it says their attendance cannot be registered.

Agent (Mr. Tan):
I see. Just to confirm, is this happening for all learners or only for certain individuals?

Customer (Ms. Lim):
It seems to be affecting about half of them.

Agent (Mr. Tan):
Understood. Are these learners using the latest version of the Singpass app? Sometimes outdated apps can cause issues.

Customer (Ms. Lim):
I’m not entirely sure, but I can check with them. Would that really cause the problem?

Agent (Mr. Tan):
Yes, it could. Additionally, could you confirm if the QR codes you generated are still valid? They may expire after a specific time.

Customer (Ms. Lim):
Oh, I didn’t realize they expire. The QR codes were generated last week for the sessions.

Agent (Mr. Tan):
That might be the issue. QR codes for e-attendance are only valid for 24 hours. You’ll need to regenerate them for each session.

Customer (Ms. Lim):
Ah, I see. That makes sense. I’ll ensure the trainers regenerate the codes going forward. Is there anything else we should check?

Agent (Mr. Tan):
It’s also good to remind learners to ensure their Singpass app permissions for scanning QR codes are enabled. If the problem persists, you can contact us again, and we’ll escalate the issue.

Customer (Ms. Lim):
Got it. Thanks, Mr. Tan. I’ll check these points and update my team.

Agent (Mr. Tan):
You’re welcome, Ms. Lim. Thank you for contacting SkillsFuture Singapore. Have a great day ahead!

Customer (Ms. Lim):
You too! Bye!

Agent (Mr. Tan):
Goodbye!
